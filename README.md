Newsbase is supposed to be site for journalists and people looking for news go to see the news and get the news fast and easy in a social media like type platform.

It's modeled heavly after reddit. It has a funcitoning Up vote and Down vote system, and the post that has the most up votes, is then set as the top post.

Both comments and posts are able to be up voted or downvoted. 

Only members who have an account are able to post and see comments as well. I made a sign in bar at the top of the navbar where there is an email input field, a  password input field and a sign in button. Along with  Forgot Password and Create Account options for new users. It was came with one of the logins package I installed on meteor.

When loggin in again, the create post tab will appear at the top of the screen, so the user with an account will be able to post. 

Clicking the newsbase icon in the upper left hand corner will also take you to the home screen. 

This website is incredibly simple, and since I am fairly new to coding and front end web development, I tried to stick to the basic requirements of this assignment even though I wanted to do much more. It took me so long to do just this process, but I tried to hit all of the assignment requirements in some way.# mdeabler.github.io
